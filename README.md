Pretty format all your json files at once in place with three characters

### Usage

```jpf```

Just typing in the three magic characters will pretty format all your `*.json` files in the current folder and all subfolders.
Since the command is recursive `jpf` should be used with caution.

### Installation

`jpf` is as very simple to install using pip:
```pip install jpf```
